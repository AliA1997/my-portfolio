What are Access Modifiers?

There are levels of access you can specify for specific constructs. 
The only ones that you can’t be have a access modifier is based on their accessibility domain. 
How you would know their accessibility level would be based on the member accessibility level, and containing type accessibility level. 
Never can the nested type have more access than the type itself.

---

Let's do a little coding.

We will have all our properties in our PublicClass.cs file. It will contain 5 properties all varying in access levels.

A private Name1 property which would have the least amount of access, only can be accessed within the class.

A protected Name2 property which would have the second least amount of access, only can be accessed from a derived class.

A internal Name3 property which would have the third least amount of access, only can be accessed within it’s current assembly or namespace.

A public Name4 property which would have the most amount of access, it can be access through out the application.

Then a protected internal Name5 property which we would combine two access modifiers. It can be accessed in the current assembly or namespace, and can be access in a derived class.

We would define all these properties within our constructor which take the corresponding properties lowercase as arguments, all would be strings. Then we would assign those argument to our properties.
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;

namespace AccessModifiersTutorial
{
    class PublicClass
    {
        //Define constructor method
        public PublicClass(string name1, string name2, string name3, string name4, string name5)
        {
            Name1 = name1;
            Name2 = name2;
            Name3 = name3;
            Name4 = name4;
            Name5 = name5;
        }
        //Define your members of your class here.
        //Private is the access level that provides the least accesss, only you can accesss the value within the class.
        private string Name1 { get; set; }
        //Protected is the access level that provides the second least access
        //only you can access the value within a class or a inherited class.
        protected string Name2 { get; set; }
        //internal means it can be accessed in it's current assembly/namespace
        //BUT NOT in a inherited assembly/namespace.
        internal string Name3 { get; set; }
        //public means it can be accessed throughout the application
        //It has the most access. 
        public string Name4 { get; set; }
        //Can combine multiple access modifiers.
        //You can combine protected and internal, so it can be accessed in a class and a derived class
        //and the same assembly/namespace.
        protected internal string Name5 { get; set; }
        //You can also combine protected and private, so it can be accessed in it's class and a derived class.
        //But it is fairly new to c#, so the minimum version would be 7.2
        //private protected string Name6 { get; set; } 
    }
}
```
Feel free to [look at github gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/AliA1997/95c5b2adfb6d07c7f7a5f6fbfa59b876/raw/083b48ce32ca31ca57cdab34456e222eacb9dd49/PublicClass.cs) if you would like to look at the code.

Now in your Program.cs file within you Main method, create a new instance of your PublicClass, and assign it to a variable called exampleClass.
```csharp
//Define your instance of your class.
PublicClass exampleClass = new PublicClass(name1: "Name 1", name2: "Name 2", name3: "Name 3", name4: "Name 4", name5: "Name 5"); 
```

The private access modifier will give your member of your class or variable the least amount of access. 
When your try it to log into the console it will give you an error. 
You would use the private access modifier when implementing logic for your getter’s and setters, by assigning it to a variable and manipulating that variable within your setter, and returning it in your getter.

```csharp
/Log your private property to console.
//It will give your error, it can only be accessed within the class.
Console.WriteLine(exampleClass.Name1);
```
Log private property into the console.

The protected access modifier it will give your member of your class or variable the second least amount of access. 
It can only be accessed from a derived class or a inherited class. 
When your try to log into the console, it will give you a error.
```csharp
//Log your protected property to the console.
//It will give you a error, it can only be accessed within class or another class inherited.
Console.WriteLine(exampleClass.Name2);
```
Log protected property into the console.

The internal access modifier will give your member of your class or variable that third least amount of access. 
It can be only accessed from the same namespace.
When your try to log into the console, it will log it successfully, because the PublicClass is in the same namespace. 
Used in component based development, primarily as a static value.
```csharp
//Log your internal property which would log into the console, since it is in the same assembly/namespace.
Console.WriteLine(exampleClass.Name3);
```
Log internal property into the console.

The public access modifier gives your member, and property the most access. Therefore can be accessed throughout your application.
```csharp
//Log your public property which would be logged into the console.
//Since it can be accessed throughout the application.
Console.WriteLine(exampleClass.Name4);
```
Log public property into the console.

You can also combine access modifiers, for example you can have your protected and internal access modifier combined. 
Which means it can be accessed within the class or the class inherited or the namespace. When you log into the console, it would work.
```csharp
//Can combine multiple access modifiers.
//You can combine protected and internal, so it can be accessed in a class and a derived class
//and the same assembly/namespace.
Console.WriteLine(exampleClass.Name5);
```
Log your protected and internal property into the console.

Well those are a couple of examples.
